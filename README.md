# orger
files organizer for lazy ones
***
## installation
You just need to add it to your path or link/move it to an global place like `/usr/bin`
link example  
```sudo ln -s /path/to/orger /usr/bin/orger```

## defining types 
For now you have to create a file called `.filetypes` in your `~/` folder because the orger will search for it to start the process, It's a csv formatted list BTW
